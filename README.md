## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Visual Studio 2022** (with ASP.NET and web development workload)
- **SQL Server** (e.g., SQL Server Express) and **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **.NET 8 SDK** (or later)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up Agri-Energy Connect on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agri-energy-connect.git
cd agri-energy-connect
2. Set Up the Database
The database script (AgriEnergyConnect.sql) is included in the repository. To set it up:

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to your SQL Server instance.
Go to File > Open > File‚Ä¶ and select AgriEnergyConnect.sql from the repository.
If the script specifies a file path for the database files (e.g., C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\...), modify the path to match your SQL Server data directory (e.g., C:\Your\SQL\Server\Data\Path\).
Click Execute (or press F5) to run the script. This will create the AgriEnergyConnect database with tables (Farmers, Products, etc.) and sample data.
Refresh the "Databases" node in Object Explorer to confirm the database is created.


3. Configure the Connection String
Open appsettings.json in the project root and update the connection string to match your SQL Server instance:

json

Copy
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server_name;Database=AgriEnergyConnect;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
Replace your_server_name with your SQL Server instance name (e.g., localhost or .\SQLEXPRESS if using SQL Server Express).
If using SQL Server Authentication, replace Trusted_Connection=True with User Id=your_username;Password=your_password;.


4. Install Dependencies
Open the project in Visual Studio 2022:

Right-click the solution in Solution Explorer and select Restore NuGet Packages to install dependencies (e.g., Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core Identity).
Ensure the following packages are installed (check AgriEnergyConnect.csproj):
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore


5. Apply Migrations (Optional)
If you modify the database schema, apply migrations to update the database:

bash

Copy
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
However, since the provided .sql script already sets up the database, you can skip this step unless you make changes to the models.

6. Run the Application
In Visual Studio, press F5 (or click the "Run" button) to build and run the application.
The app should launch in your default browser at https://localhost:7111 (port may vary).
You‚Äôll be redirected to the login page if not authenticated.
